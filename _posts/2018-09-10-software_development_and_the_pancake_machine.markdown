I’ve chosen to learn software development with Flatiron School because I want waffles with warm syrup.

I currently serve as the Director of Production Services for a continuing medical education start-up. My CTO uses a delicious analogy to describe the work our team does: we are in the business of [pancake machines](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNsnSSsBu44). Imagine on a buffet line a machine that creates pancakes with a touch of a button. 

In this analogy, the machine manufacturer is our team of developers - responsible for maintenance, introducing new features, or deciding it’s time to scrap the old machine and roll out the new model. The diners are our sales team, the pancakes their deliverables. The chefs who develop batter recipes are our scientific directors and their content. 

As the head of Production, I am the machine operator and kitchen expeditor. Since we don’t allow the diners to push the buttons on their own, I validate and prioritize orders (spec) from the diners, and serve the pancakes (deliverables) when they’re done. I maintain the machine on a very basic level, but I have the manufacturer’s number on speed dial for when the machine malfunctions to a point beyond my own ability to repair it.

It’s a great gig I have, but being able to only work with production code limits me to very specific pancakes. Sometimes I get orders for warm syrup on the pancakes, or some other feature that hasn’t been implemented in our machine. I can only dive into the code so deep with my current abilities, so even though its a simple enough request, I must either defer to the developers to solve this issue (which is inefficient; they’re working on bigger, more important features) or, find some workaround or separate process to get warm syrup on the pancakes (which is inelegant; a pancake machine should be able to handle this kind of request). From this program, I hope to be able to dive deeper and more efficiently into code, with independence, confidence, and purpose.

Working with production code limits me in at least one other way: I can’t fulfill an order for waffles. Pancakes pay the bills - they’re our best selling product - and we have built a reputation for having excellent pancakes. But there are plenty of folks out there (myself included) that prefer waffles. I want to learn full stack web development not only so I can learn to build a waffle machine from scratch, but so I can perhaps manage an entire team to develop a whole melange of different tasty breakfast treat machines. 

My career in tech so far is marked by superlative organizational skills, power user instinct, and the ability to navigate deeply flawed legacy systems (I would estimate 40% of my work deals with CFML). The pancake machine was a great place to start, but I am ready for more. To quote one of my colleagues in Dev Ops, I am ready not to work *harder*, but to work *smarter*. I am hoping on the other side of the Flatiron Full Stack Web Development curriculum is a career in tech characterized by innovation, collaboration, efficiency, and leadership. 

And lots and lots of waffles with warm syrup.
